These events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and additional resources are available on the <a calss="neon" href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/graphics-project">Graphics Project Webpage</a>.</p>
