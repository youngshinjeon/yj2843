    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>What should come first, houses or museums?</h3>
    <p>Everything at once: the houses, the schools, the museums, the libraries. Urban Planning cannot ignore cultural issues. If in the construction of new
    neighbourhoods, new housing forms the basis of the city plan(and by housing we also mean the market, the schools, and the public services like
     the hospital and the post offices),the planning of a city cannot overlook two key public buildings that still today are considered an intellectual
    luxury: <strong>the Museum and the Library.</strong></p>

        <h2>Defining Museums</h2>
        <h3><strong>Museum?</strong> What is a museum?</h3>
        <p> In everyday life, when we want to describe a person, thing, or idea that is outdated,not practical or useful, we often say, "they belong in a museum."
            The expression is a clear indicator of the place museums occupy in contemporary culture, the perception of as dusty, useless spaces. Sometimes
            museums are merely the stage for the exhibitionist antics of architects who, rather than designing them to showcase the "pieces", create complex
            confections with a decorative character that gets in the way of the "museology."
            On other occasions, the museum is the setting for dilettantes, for ladies who lunch looking for something to fill the time, who dabble in sculpture,
            painting, or ceramics and exhibit their handicraft in "museums" that generally lack the one thing
            that ought to be there: a real collection of painting and sculpture.</p>

        <h2>The Modern Museum</h2>
        <p>The modern museum has to be a <em>Didactic museum</em>, able to marry conservation with the message that it is the art that must be highlighted, while
        everything else has a far more modest role. This has to be clearly understood by the architect, who should never use the commission as an opportunity
        for self-aggrandising pyrotechnics. Examples of this are seen at the Castello Sforzesco and the Beistegui Collection at the Louvre in Paris.

        <h2>Didactic and Technical Approach</h2>
        <p>The problem of the museum has to be tackled today on didactic and technical grounds. These foundations are essential if the museum is not to become
           petrified and entirely useless.</p>

        <h2>The Role of São Paulo Museum of Art</h2>
        <p>The experience gained in this field with the São Paulo Museum of Art can be of great use here. What is the point of an isolated work of art, even if
           exhibited with the most perfect museological technique, if it remains an end in itself, with no connection to our times or historical continuity?</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These considerations are of the utmost importance as Bahia stands on the brink of creating what could well one day become the country’s most 
           important museum: the Santa Teresa Museum of Sacred Art. A museum that ought to have its own didactic voice in order to become a true museum, 
           which is alive, and not a museum in the most obsolete use of the term.</p>
