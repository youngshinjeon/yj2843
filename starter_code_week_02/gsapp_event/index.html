<p>We examine various methods of visual communication used to convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and additional resources are available on the Graphics Project Webpage.</p>
